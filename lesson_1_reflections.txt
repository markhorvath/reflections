How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed me the exact lines that were added or removed which narrowed my search for changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would help you learn from past mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in
Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: Manual gives more control and is more logical, Cons: More room for user error

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because some are designed for code

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the commit IDs, messages and date, git diff shows the differences between to commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It allows you freedom knowing you can go back to previous commits if necessary

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use it on the Website Performance Project
